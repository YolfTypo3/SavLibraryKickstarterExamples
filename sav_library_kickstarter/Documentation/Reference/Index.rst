Reference
=========

The TCA configuration generated by the kickstarter is available and
can be changed for each view by means of the field configuration
interface. The SAV Library makes it possible to enter data in the
Front End. However, in most cases data can also be input in the Back
End using the regular interface. In this case, the SAV Library
specific configuration are not taken into account. Configuration are
input in the text area as shown below. The size of the text area will
grow with the number of configuration lines.

The following configurations have been added for the SAV Library. They
are organized in the alphabetic order of the field type. Of course, no
type is provided for the general configuration which can be applied to
any field and to the function options. 

.. tip::
   The configuration can also be
   obtained directly in the kickstarter by clicking on the context
   sensitive help icon (the question mark icon just above the text area).
