  the checkbox if the **Single** view must be non-cachable. 
  
- **Single view with a condition field**: these fields are created by clicking
  on the **plus** icon at the right hand side of **Single view**. Provide a name

  is used. By default, the plugin will behave as USER_INT (no caching) for 
  all the forms.
