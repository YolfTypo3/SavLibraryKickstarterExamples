Managing Extension Versions
===========================

Management of extension versions was introduced in version 0.5.0 of 
the SAV Library Kickstarter. In the extension list, clicking on the extension 
version leads to a selector box with the available extension versions as shown below.
Select the version you want to work with and it will be loaded.

.. important::    

   The extension used by the SAV Library is always the last generated one.
   When the extension in use is not the latest version, the 
   extension version is displayed in red in the extension list as shown below.
