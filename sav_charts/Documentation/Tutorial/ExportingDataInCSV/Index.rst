Exporting Data in CSV
=====================

You can easily export data associated with any chart using the exportCSV method 
associated with the **<charts>** tag (see :ref:`chart.exportCsv`).

Assuming that we want to export data associated with the line chart template with 
a row header containing the x-axis labels and a column header containing the legend labels of
the two curves. Add the following code in the **Templates** section of the flexform.

Now, in the front end you should see an icon under the legend.
Click on the icon to open the CSV file.
