What Does it Do?
================

This extension was created with the `SAV Library Kickstarter 
<https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sav_library_kickstarter>`_ in
order to be used with the `SAV Library Plus
<https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sav_library_plus>`_
extension.

The SAV Library Extension Kickstarter makes it possible to directly
build extensions  **without any PHP coding**, thanks to simple
configuration parameters.

The SAV Library Kickstarter includes:

- Creation of multiple views of the data,

- Frontend input of the data,

- Views with folders,

- Context Sensitive Help,

- Generation of emails,

- Generation of RTF files using database tags,

- Data export in CSV format,

- Many other features.

This very simple extension makes it possible to download documents. A
new icon indicates the new documents during 15 days and icons are
associated with the file type (see the field configurations). Sorting
is available by clicking on **Date** or **Category** in the title bar.
